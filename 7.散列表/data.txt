Nowadays, with the development of economic globalization, the structure of the supply chain has shown the feature of globalization. This feature has brought many conveniences to the supply chain, but also brought natural and man-made risks. In this context, maintaining and improving the resilience of the supply chain is important. And the supplier selection problem (SSP) has become the key. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on the resilient supplier selection problem (RSSP), they pay more attention to suppliers, not to manufacturers and the ripple effect they suffer.
This paper studies resilient the supplier selection problem with ripple effect (RSSPRE). First, based on the Bayesian network theory, we establish a disruption risk model for the causal relationship between regional disasters and supplier interruptions. This model can calculate the probability of supplier disruption risks. Secondly, in order to quantify the propagation of the ripple effect, a ripple effect model is established using the ripple effect simulation method combined with the Bayesian network. Then, we establish a two-stage mixed integer programming model based on the disruption risk model and the ripple effect model to solve RSSRE. The first stage is used to decide active strategies before disasters and to isolate suppliers. The second stage is used to decide response strategies after disasters and to select alternate suppliers. Finally, this paper uses MATLAB R2016a to code, and we analyze the effectiveness of the model by solving instances with CPLEX solver and computational experiments.
The model proposed in this paper can be used as a decision support tool, and help high-tech manufacturers to evaluate the spread of risks and make decisions about suppliers in scenarios where there is a great risk of disruption. At the same time, the research conclusions can provide some management recommendations.
